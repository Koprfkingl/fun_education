=====================Responsibility disclosure=======================

This application is a study project on topic of proggraming in python
language. Medical information provided by the application is not 
guaranteed. 

The author(s) is (are) not responsible for the medical condition of 
the patient nor for the treatment. The person responsible for the 
treatment is the one administering the treatment to the patient. 

Basic recommendation is to read the leaflet and to verify the 
information provided by the app. 

Best effort to provide as accurate medical information as possible 
was made, yet provided information may be outdated or may contain 
errors. Also pharmacists or doctors might have prescribed usage of 
Nurofen that is not covered in the leaflet and the application has no
means to obtain such information. Also new product under name Nurofen
might have come to market and application might not be reflecting 
such situation.

DO NOT TRUST, VERIFY!

========================Project description==========================

!!! BASED ON OFFICIAL LEAFLET. TO BE FOUND UNDER FOLLOWING LINK !!!
https://pribalovy-letak.info/nurofen-pro-deti

Purpose of the project is to provide support on dosage of Nurofen for
children, which is being used as treatment for high fever to children 
age of 3 months and older. 

Reason for support is, that Nurofen has maximum dosage per 24 hours
and maximal dosage of main substance in single dose. If greatest 
single dose is being used over course of 24hrs, the child will be 
overdosed.

Also the volume given to child must be calculated based on weight 
of the child or approximated based on age of child.

To assist worried parents I have created following apps. I must 
stress out, that I had no support from producer of Nurofen, therefore
data provided in apps should NOT be rellied upon. I have built the 
apps on leaflet distributed with Nurofen in Czech Republic, year 2022.
