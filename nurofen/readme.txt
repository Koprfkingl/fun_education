========================Project description==========================

Purpose of the project is to provide support on dosage of Nurofen for
kids, which is being used as treatment for high fever to smallest 
children. 

Reason for support is, that Nurofen has maximum dosage per 24 hours
and maximal dosage of main substance in single dose. If greatest 
single dose is being used over course of 24hrs, the child will be 
overdosed.

Also the volume given to child must be calculated based on weight 
of the child or approximated based on age of child.

To assist worried parents I have created following apps. I must 
stress out, that I had no support from producer of Nurofen, therefore
data provided in apps should NOT be rellied upon. I have built the 
apps on leaflet distributed with Nurofen in Czech Republic, year 2022.
